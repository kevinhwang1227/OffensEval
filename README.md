## OffensEval Submission

This repository details our submission for the OffensEval 2019 challenge, details of which can be found [here](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20011).

Our approach involved the use of the BERT language model for word embeddings as a feature extractor, with a single fully connected classification layer on top.

The full report of our findings can be found in the `Report.pdf` file.
